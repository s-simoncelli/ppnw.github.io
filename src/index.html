    <h3>Physical Processes in Natural Waters Workshop</h3>

    <p>The PPNW workshops explore the physics of lakes and coastal water bodies. They look at the interactions with
      the physical and biogeochemical processes that control water quality, ecosystem functions, and the services
      these systems provide.</p>

    <p>The open workshop seeks to expand contacts with neighbouring fields such as physical oceanography, the
      atmospheric sciences, and engineering. With forty to sixty participants and a small number of invited
      speakers, the PPNW meetings combine an active workshop atmosphere with a comfortable timeframe for
      presentations and discussions.</p>
